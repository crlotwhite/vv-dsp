# vv-dsp Library Enhancement PRD
# Product Requirements Document for DSP Library Improvements

## Executive Summary
Based on comprehensive analysis of modern DSP libraries including Cycfi/Q, CMSIS-DSP, GNU Radio, and emerging techniques, this PRD outlines strategic enhancements to improve vv-dsp's capabilities, performance, and usability.

## Project Overview
Enhance the vv-dsp library with modern DSP techniques, advanced algorithms, and improved developer experience based on competitive analysis and industry best practices.

## Background & Motivation
Current vv-dsp is a solid C99 DSP library but lacks several modern features found in contemporary DSP frameworks:
- Limited window function variety (only Hanning/Hamming vs CMSIS-DSP's 9 types)
- No adaptive filtering capabilities 
- Basic MFCC implementation without advanced features
- No type safety mechanisms for DSP parameters
- Limited real-time streaming support
- No advanced signal conditioning features
- Missing modern pitch detection algorithms
- No wavelet transform support

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Implement advanced window functions matching CMSIS-DSP standards
2. Add adaptive filtering capabilities for dynamic environments
3. Enhance MFCC implementation with mel-scale improvements
4. Introduce type-safe DSP parameter handling
5. Implement real-time streaming architecture

### Secondary Goals
1. Add wavelet transform support for time-frequency analysis
2. Implement modern pitch detection algorithms
3. Add advanced signal conditioning features
4. Create comprehensive performance benchmarking suite
5. Improve developer documentation and examples

## Technical Requirements

### 2. Adaptive Filtering System
- Implement LMS (Least Mean Squares) adaptive filter
- Add NLMS (Normalized LMS) with variable step size
- Include RLS (Recursive Least Squares) for faster convergence
- Support real-time coefficient adaptation
- Provide noise cancellation and echo cancellation examples

### 3. Enhanced MFCC Implementation
- Add configurable mel-scale filters (40-128 filters)
- Implement delta and delta-delta (acceleration) coefficients
- Add energy normalization options
- Support different DCT types (Type-II, Type-III)
- Include cepstral mean normalization (CMN)

### 4. Type-Safe DSP Parameters
- Create frequency, duration, and amplitude types
- Add compile-time unit validation
- Implement automatic unit conversions
- Provide type-safe filter design functions
- Add range checking for DSP parameters

### 5. Real-Time Streaming Architecture
- Implement block-based processing pipeline
- Add circular buffer management

### 6. Wavelet Transform Support
- Implement Daubechies wavelets (db1-db10)
- Add Haar wavelet transform
- Support continuous wavelet transform (CWT)
- Include scalogram generation
- Provide time-frequency analysis tools

### 7. Modern Pitch Detection
- Implement YIN algorithm for fundamental frequency
- Add autocorrelation-based pitch detection
- Support harmonic product spectrum (HPS)
- Include pitch tracking over time
- Provide musical note detection

### 8. Signal Conditioning Features
- Add DC removal filters
- Implement automatic gain control (AGC)
- Support dynamic range compression
- Add noise gating functionality
- Include signal quality metrics

## Performance Requirements
- Maintain C99 compatibility
- Ensure SIMD optimization opportunities
- Target <1ms latency for real-time processing
- Support sample rates up to 192kHz
- Minimize memory allocation during processing

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing API compatibility
- Pure C implementation (no C++ dependencies)
- Optional dependencies only (no mandatory external libs)
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Embedded system compatibility

## Success Criteria
- All new features have comprehensive unit tests
- Performance benchmarks show <10% overhead
- Documentation includes practical examples
- Code coverage >95% for new implementations
- Memory usage remains reasonable for embedded targets

## Implementation Strategy
1. Implement foundational improvements (window functions, type safety)
2. Add adaptive filtering and enhanced MFCC
3. Build streaming architecture and signal conditioning
4. Implement advanced features (wavelets, pitch detection)
5. Optimize performance and finalize documentation

## Timeline Expectations
- Phase 1 (Foundation): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2 (Core Features): 3-4 weeks  
- Phase 3 (Streaming & Conditioning): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 4 (Advanced Features): 3-4 weeks
- Phase 5 (Optimization & Docs): 1-2 weeks

## Dependencies & Resources
- Existing vv-dsp codebase and test infrastructure
- Optional: Reference implementations for validation
- Performance profiling tools for optimization
- Documentation tools for enhanced guides

## Risk Assessment
- Complexity of adaptive algorithms may require iteration
- Type safety system design needs careful API consideration  
- Real-time streaming requires extensive testing
- Wavelet transforms are mathematically complex
- Performance optimization may conflict with readability

This enhancement will position vv-dsp as a modern, comprehensive DSP library competitive with industry standards while maintaining its C99 simplicity and embedded-system friendliness.
