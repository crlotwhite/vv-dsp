## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation (Subtask 26.2)

2. **Memory Alignment Infrastructure**
   - `vv_dsp_aligned_malloc()` / `vv_dsp_aligned_free()`
   - 32-byte alignment for AVX2, 64-byte for AVX512
   - Update critical data structures (FFT plans, buffers)

### Phase 2: x86 Implementation (Subtask 26.3)
**Target Order by Impact:**
1. Sinc resampling kernels (highest ROI)
2. Core vector arithmetic functions
3. FFT butterfly operations
4. Windowing and framing operations

### Phase 3: ARM NEON (Subtask 26.4)

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- Vector arithmetic functions (simple, well-tested patterns)
- Windowing operations (element-wise operations)

**Medium Risk:**

- Memory alignment (ABI compatibility)

**High Risk:**
- Sinc resampling (complex algorithm, edge cases)
- Runtime backend switching (state management)

## Testing Strategy

1. **Numerical Verification:**
   - All SIMD implementations must match scalar reference within epsilon
   - Cross-validation with Python/NumPy reference implementations

2. **Performance Validation:**
   - Before/after benchmarks using existing framework
   - Automated regression detection in CI

   - Valgrind/AddressSanitizer validation
   - Alignment verification in debug builds

## Conclusion

The vv-dsp library shows excellent potential for SIMD optimization with expected performance improvements of 4-16x for critical functions. The primary targets are high-quality resampling operations and core vector arithmetic, which currently limit overall system performance.

The implementation should prioritize the highest-impact functions first (Sinc resampling), followed by broadly-used operations (vector arithmetic and FFT). With proper implementation, the library could achieve sub-millisecond real-time factors for typical audio processing workloads.

**Next Action:** Proceed to Subtask 26.2 - Implement SIMD abstraction layer and aligned memory allocator.
